# About 
Useful informatin about using git / GitHub. Also see [getting started with GitHub](https://github.com/ProfessorKaos64/documents/blob/master/git/getting-started-with-github.md).


# Commands

## branch

### Rename your local branch.
If you are on the branch you want to rename:

```
git branch -m new-name
```

If you are on a different branch:

```
git branch -m old-name new-name
```

Delete the old-name remote branch and push the new-name local branch.

```
git push origin :old-name new-name
```

Reset the upstream branch for the new-name local branch.

Switch to the branch and then:
```
git push origin -u new-name
```

## checkout

### Reset a file you deleted/modified

```
git checkout <COMMIT_TO_USE> -- file1/to/restore file2/to/restore
```

## clone

https
```
git clone https://github.com/username/repo
```

ssh
```
git clone ssh://git@github.com/username/
```

## push

### push as another user

Just to add to this: The `--author` option mentioned in the accepted answer will only override the author, not the committer information of the commit.

That is the correct behavior in most cases, but if for some reason you need to manually override the committer information as well, use the GIT_COMMITTER_NAME and GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL environment variables (there is a GIT_COMMITTER_DATE as well). See Git-Internals-Environment-Variables

```
$ GIT_COMMITTER_NAME="New Name" GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL="name@email.com" git commit --author="New Name <name@email.com>"
```
This will make the commit look like it was authored and committed by the specified user.

## Log

### Committed changes to be pushed

```
git log origin/<BRANCH>..HEAD
```

## stash

### Stash only a specific commit, or set of them. 
You can use`git stash -p`. This way you can select which hunks should be added to stash, whole files can be selected as well.

### Retrieve a stash

```
git stash list
git stash apply --index
```

See: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v1/Git-Tools-Stashing

## rebase

### Squashing commits

1. reset your branch on our master
```
git remote add upstream /url/to/original/repo
```
2. assuming you added xbmc-packaging as remote and origin is your own repo: 
```
git fetch xbmc-packaging; git rebase -i xbmc-packaging/master
```
3. during rebase make sure only your own commits are picked, then squash (s) all down to 1
4. Force push
```
git push -f origin yourbranch
```

## revert

Revert a branch back to specific commit:

```
git revert --no-commit 0766c053..HEAD
git commit
```

Source: [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4114095/how-to-revert-git-repository-to-a-previous-commit)

If that proves to much trouble, you can try a hard reset:

```
git reset --hard <COMMIT>
git clean -f
git push origin <BRANCH> --force
```

Or
```
git reset --hard HEAD~
```

## submodule

### Creating

```
git submodule add https://github.com/<user>/<repo_name> <OPTIONAL_PATH_AND_MODULE_NAME>
```

### Updating

Pull in latest changes for submodule
```
git submodule update --remote <PATH_TO_WITH_MODULE_NAME>
```

### Have a sudmodule always track the HEAD of a branch

Note: This is dangerous and not recommended. Original source is [here](http://stackoverflow.com/a/31851819)

As I mention in "git submodule tracking latest", you can since git 1.8.2 (March 2013) make a submodule track the HEAD of branch:

```
git submodule add -b <branch> <repository> [<path>]
```

A submodule SHA1 is still recorded in the parent repo as a gitlink (special entry in the index).
But a git submodule update --remote will update that entry to the SHA1 matching the HEAD of a branch of the submodule remote repo.

If you have an existing submodule, you can make it follow a branch with:
```
cd /path/to/your/parent/repo
git config -f .gitmodules submodule.<path>.branch <branch>

cd path/to/your/submodule
git checkout -b branch --track origin/branch

# if the master branch already exist:
git branch -u origin/master master

cd /path/to/your/parent/repo
git add path/to/your/submodule
git commit -m "Make submodule tracking a branch"
```
### Removal 

* Delete the relevant line from the .gitmodules file.
* Delete the relevant section from .git/config.
* Run git rm --cached path_to_submodule (no trailing slash).
* Commit and delete the now untracked submodule files.

## Reviewing

### Git Diff

```
git diff HEAD^ HEAD
```

(HEAD^ means the previous version of head; leaving off the second HEAD would show any uncommitted changes lying around as well.)

To limit to a particular file, in this case "midbucket.view.inc" in the directory from which we run the command:

```
git diff HEAD^ HEAD -- midbucket.view.inc
```

Reference

### Git logs

Entire log
```
git log
```

Per author
```
git log --author=root
```

Listing all authors *except* a set of authors

This uses the advanced "negative lookahead" feature available in PCRE, perl-based regex functionality. Your version of grep must support PCRE, so you'll need to check the way your vendor builds it. There are tips out there for how to rebuild or get other versions if needed.

```
$ git config --global grep.patternType perl
$ git log --author='^((?!pattern).*)$'

# Example
git log --perl-regexp --author='^((?!excluded-author1-regex)(?!excluded-author2-regex).*)$'
```

One line
```
git log --author=root --pretty=oneline --abbrev-commit
```

### Checking git status items

simple
```
git status
```

Checking branch status info
```
# On branch master
# Your branch and 'origin/master' have diverged,
# and have 4 and 4 different commits each, respectively.
#   (use "git pull" to merge the remote branch into yours)

git log HEAD..origin/master
```

# Reviewing Code

Diff style:
```
git log --follow -p -- <filename>
```

Using `git blame`
```
git blame <FILE>
```

# Tools / Utilities

## dch

Example creation:
```
dch --create -v 1.0 -M --package voglperf -D brewmaster
```

This tells dch to create the changelog, with the 1.0 initial verion, name it voglperf, and set the distribution to brewmaster.

Example increment
```
dch -i -v 1.0 -M --package voglperf -D brewmaster
```
In this example we are applying most of the same options but just incrementing the version
